# Take-A-Bite

Take-A-Bite is a web application designed to help users easily browse and order food from a variety of restaurants. The project was built as a portfolio piece for Holberton School and aimed at learning full-stack web development using technologies like Python (Flask), JavaScript, SQLAlchemy, and jQuery.

Take-A-Bite was created with the goal of simplifying the online food ordering experience, particularly for users in Accra, Ghana. It provides users with a seamless way to select food, customize their order, and complete payments. 

I worked on both the backend and frontend, focusing on delivering a robust and user-friendly experience. My role involved:
- Building and managing database models using SQLAlchemy
- Developing Flask routes for data handling and payment processing
- Creating dynamic and responsive frontend pages using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (with jQuery).
