                <h2>About Take-A-Bite</h2>
                <p>
                    Take-A-Bite was born out of a passion for making food delivery and pick-up more convenient in Accra.
                    What makes Take-A-Bite special is our focus on simplicity, and user experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether you're grabbing lunch or quick snack, Take-A-Bite ensures that your food arrives hot, fresh,
                    and on time. This project is not only a practical tool but also a portfolio project 
                    developed during my time at ALX School.
